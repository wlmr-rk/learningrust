//Today I will be learning about Rust's formatting capabilities.
//Day 1: Basic Formatting
//I will create a simple program that prints my name, country, and age.
////I will also explore different formatting options like hexadecimal and binary representations of
///my age.
/////I will also learn how to get the length of a string in Rust.
/////I will use the println! macro for output and format specifiers like {:x} for hexadecimal and
///{:b} for binary.
//////I will also learn how to use the len() method to get the length of a string.
/////I will run the program to see the output and ensure everything works as expected.
/////I will also explore how to use comments in Rust to document my code.
